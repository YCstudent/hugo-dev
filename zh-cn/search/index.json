[{"content":"Written text 1. Vocabulary Explanation Problem-Solving Approach • Identify the sentence in the text where the word or phrase appears and understand its meaning from the context.\n• Pay attention to the emotional tone and context of the word to avoid literal interpretations.\nTips • Observe context: Determine the word’s role in the sentence (e.g., describing actions, feelings), especially with surrounding words.\n• Find synonyms or concise phrases that match the context.\nTemplate • Here, the word/phrase means “(explanation of the word)” in this context, particularly\u0026hellip;(explanations)”.\nExample • Original sentence：“She decided to kick it to the curb.”\n• Answer： Here, \u0026ldquo;kick it to the curb\u0026rdquo; means to abandon or get rid of something, particularly a bad habit or undesirable behavior.\n2.Sentence Paraphrasing Problem-Solving Approach • Grasp the core idea of the sentence and then express it with different structures or words.\n• Ensure the rephrased sentence maintains the original meaning and tone.\nTips • Break down the sentence: Identify the key components like subject, verb, and object.\n• Replace synonyms and adjust structure for conciseness.\nExample • Original sentence： “It is up to parents to work with their children to find a good balance.”\n• Answers：\nParents are responsible for collaborating with their children to achieve a proper balance between mobile phone usage and other significant life activities.\nTo find a good balance between mobile phone use and other important life activities, it is the parents\u0026rsquo; job to work together with their children.\nCollaborating with their children to strike a good balance between mobile phone use and other vital life activities is a task for parents.\nParents are tasked with working alongside their children to find equilibrium between mobile phone use and other significant activities in life.\n3.Main Opinion Problem-Solving Approach • Locate the central theme, usually found in the introduction, conclusion, or key transitional sections.\n• Simplify the author’s main point into one sentence to clearly express their stance.\nTips • Find the core opinion sentence that directly states the author’s viewpoint.\n• Keep it concise: Summarize the main point without unnecessary details.\nTemplate The author\u0026rsquo;s opinions can be\u0026hellip;\nExample • Answer：\nThe author\u0026rsquo;s main opinion is that social media and excessive use of mobile devices can lead to false views of life, negative feelings, health problems, and reduced productivity among young people. Parents should work with their children to find a balance between mobile phone use and other important activities.\nThe author\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that while social media and mobile devices have become integral parts of modern life, they should be used responsibly, and there is a need for awareness and balance to prevent the negative impacts on young people\u0026rsquo;s lives.\n4.Supporting Evidence Problem-Solving Approach • Identify specific facts, data, or cited sources, especially sentences supported by data or research.\n• Explain the source and validity of the evidence, analyzing whether it adequately supports the author’s opinion.\nTips Look for data or research: Focus on sentences with numbers, study citations, or references to authoritative bodies.\nAssess effectiveness and credibility: Evaluate if the source is reliable and how well it supports the opinion.\nTemplate Evidence (1mark): \u0026hellip;(contents from the text)\nSource (1mark): This evidence comes from\u0026hellip;(paragraph/others)\nValid (1mark): The evidence is (not)valid because\u0026hellip;(real-life, published,recent). ed:based on recently published\nConvincing (2 marks): The evidence is (not) convincing because\u0026hellip;(authority, sample, specific numbers)\nExample • Answers：\nEvidence (1mark): “just like most people eventually do with a bad habit” (pa 1-3)\nSource (1mark): This evidence comes from Essena O\u0026rsquo;Neill`s personal experience\nValid (1mark): The evidence is valid because Essena O\u0026rsquo;Neill\u0026rsquo;s personal experience provides a real-life example of the negative impacts of excessive social media use.\nConvincing (2 marks): The evidence is not convincing because it is a single case and may not be representative of all social media users. It lacks the generalizability of broader studies.\n(The evidence is convincing because it is a firsthand account of the pressures and realities of social media influence, which can resonate with many who follow similar lifestyles or are affected by social media.)\nEvidence: \u0026ldquo;Detailed research of over five thousand mobile phone users from Common Sense Media found that teens spend nearly nine hours a day using their devices. They also found increased time looking at screens was associated with increased weight and larger waistlines in teenagers.\u0026rdquo; (pa 4-1)\nSource: Common Sense Media, a organization that provides reviews and advice on media and technology for families.\nValid: The evidence is valid as it is based on a detailed research study conducted by a reputable organization.\nConvincing: The evidence is convincing because it is statistically significant, involving a large sample size, and it highlights the correlation between screen time and physical health, which is a widely discussed concern.\n5.Bias Analysis Problem-Solving Approach Analyze if the article only leans towards one side, particularly by only highlighting positive or negative effects.\nUse emotionally inclined words to detect whether the author holds a bias.\nTips State the level of bias(1 mark) [biased against xx]\nExplain how the author shows or does not show bias(through evidence,argument or language)(2 marks)\nGive supporting example/s (2 marks)\nTemplate • The author shows (level of bias, e.g., a moderate level of bias) because they (describe evidence of bias). For example, (specific example supporting the bias).\nExample • Answer：\n[Level of bias] The author of the article shows a moderate level of bias against social media / mobile devices, particularly among teenagers.\n[How to show bias/no bias] The author focuses on the negative aspects of social media and does not provide a balanced view by discussing any potential positive outcomes or benefits of social media use. This one-sided presentation can be seen as biased.\n[Supporting example/s] The author uses phrases like \u0026ldquo;false view of life,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;negative feelings,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;worrying effects,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;ruin a person\u0026rsquo;s productivity,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;negative consequences,\u0026rdquo; which all carry negative connotations and suggest a critical stance on the impact of social media and mobile device usage.\n[Supporting example/s] The article starts with Essena O\u0026rsquo;Neill\u0026rsquo;s story, which is used to set a negative tone about the impact of social media on self-image and mental health.\n[Supporting example/s] The statement \u0026ldquo;They are unnatural images and edited movie clips that are ranked against each other\u0026rdquo; suggests that the content on social media is artificial and competitive, which can be seen as a biased view against the authenticity of social media.\nOpposing Viewpoint Problem-Solving Approach Consider groups or individuals who might hold an opposing stance, listing their possible viewpoints and reasons.\nTake the opposite perspective of the article and propose alternative possibilities.\nTips Infer opposing positions: Find overlooked positive impacts or benefits and imagine the viewpoint of the opposing group.\nSupport with logical reasoning: Use logical reasons to explain why the opposing stance might be valid.\nTemplate Person or Groups\nAlternative point of view\nExample • Answer：\n[Person or Groups]:\nSocial Media Enthusiasts and Influencers\nTechnology Advocates\nYoung People Who Positively Utilize Social Media\n[Alternative point of view]\nAn alternate point of view could be that social media platforms offer a space for creativity, self-expression, and community building. For instance, social media has been used to raise awareness about social issues, and to provide a platform for artists and creators to share their work.\nSome could claim that with proper guidance and self-regulation, young people can use social media in a balanced and healthy way without succumbing to addiction or negative self-image.\nThey might also argue that multitasking, when managed effectively, can help individuals learn to prioritize and juggle multiple responsibilities, which is a valuable skill in today\u0026rsquo;s fast-paced world.\n7.Summary Problem-Solving Approach Review the entire article to extract the core information, briefly summarize the main idea and supporting points without direct quotes.\nInclude the source to indicate where the content originated.\nTips Summarize key points: Capture the main idea and critical supporting points while removing unnecessary details.\nParaphrase in your own words: Stay objective without copying original sentences.\nTemplate A whole paragraph\n· Main ideas\n· Supporting ideas\n· Specific details such as examples\n· Referrence to the source (Smith,2014)\nExample • Answer：\nTeen social media influencer Essena O\u0026rsquo;Neill, with nearly a million followers, revealed the dark side of her online success—self-doubt and screen addiction—ultimately quitting social media.\nResearch by Common Sense Media, which surveyed over 5,000 mobile phone users, found that teens spend nearly nine hours daily on devices, linking screen time to health issues.\nThe study also suggests that multitasking with technology can harm productivity and understanding, emphasizing the need for a balance in device use.
